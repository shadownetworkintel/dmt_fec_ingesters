Key financial data reported periodically by committees as they are reported. This feed includes summary

also incorporate any changes made by committees, if any report covering the period is amended.

Key financial data reported periodically by committees as they are reported. This feed includes summary
information from the the House F3 reports, the presidential F3p reports and the PAC and party
F3x reports.

Generally, committees file reports on a quarterly or monthly basis, but
some must also submit a report 12 days before primary elections. Therefore, during the primary
season, the period covered by this file may be different for different committees. These totals
also incorporate any changes made by committees, if any report covering the period is amended.

DISCLAIMER: The field labels contained within this resource are subject to change.  We are attempting to succinctly
label these fields while conveying clear meaning to ensure accessibility for all users.
